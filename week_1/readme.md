In this program, I just created a for loop which inputs the user data and runs the loop until the Number of students the user has input has reached. It then computes the average, min and max and outputs in tabular form. I created a `Data.txt` file to take as `StdIn` for my program. I created an extra list `student_marks`, as I was having some difficulty accessing the `marks` item  of my dictionary individually.

## Output 3:

Defined a function which splits the lyrics line by line and displays it with 1.5s delay.
